<h1>The Screen Bouncer</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

I wonder, have you ever encountered a bouncer? If you haven't, well you are in luck. why! You get to meet one today. And if you already have, be warned! This is not your run-off-the-mill typical bouncer. He's different. Will he hurt you, mmm, I think you will probably have to take it up with him on the field of battle (a.k.a. your screen). Check out this popular re-invented bouncer. <br>
Oh, don't forget to enjoy.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

To deploy the game, and play it on a [website](lesliecodes1.github.io/screen-bouncer/) near you, just follow the quick steps below: <br>

* Git clone the above project to your machine by entering the following command to your terminal:
  * `git clone https://github.com/lesliecodes1/screen-bouncer.git`
    * The purpose of this step is only so you can make your own modifications to the game, making it harder or easier by conguring the Computer Paddle AI.
* When ready to deploy, head on to the Settings tab on your github repo.
* Navigate to Pages, on the `Code and Automation` section.
* Under `Build and Deployment`, under `Branch`, select the publishing source. In my case, this would be the main branch.
* Your site would now be ready and live at the specified URL by github.
* Click and bounce away on your screen. <br>
